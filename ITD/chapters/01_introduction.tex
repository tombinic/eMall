\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Purpose}
The goal of \textbf{I}mplementation \textbf{a}nd \textbf{T}est \textbf{D}eliverable Document lies in a meticulous explanation of the whole developping process about eMall system according to what was defined in the previous document, \textbf{RASD} and \textbf{DD}.
The audience of the presented document is addressed to investors that deal with investments in rinnovable energies' field.
\section{Scope}
Obviously, the main scope of this document is to provide a fully detailed explanation of what was developed, from all the implemented and released software features to unit testing of each module.
