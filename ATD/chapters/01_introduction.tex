\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Purpose}
This document serves as the Acceptance Test Deliverable (ATD) for the e-Mall project. Its main objective is to thoroughly evaluate and test the project that has been developed by another group, with the aim of highlighting any potential bugs or system issues, as well as any discrepancies between the requirements described in the RASD (Requirements and Analysis Specification Document) and DD (Design Document) documents and the actual implementation.

The ATD is an important step in the software development process, as it allows the project team to verify that the final product meets all the specified requirements and functions as intended before it is released to the customer. This in turn helps to ensure the overall quality and success of the project.
